            The COVID-19 pandemic is the greatest global humanitarian challenge the world has faced
            since World War II. The virus has spread widely, and the number of cases is rising daily as
            governments work to slow its spread. India had moved swiftly, implementing a proactive,
            nationwide, 21-day lockdown, with the goal of flattening the curve and using the time to plan
            and resource responses adequately. India’s effort to combat COVID-19 virus has been
            praised over the globe. However, the lockdown came with an economic cost and cascading
            impact on all the sections of society. The Covid-19 induced lockdown in India was a huge
            economic shock. It started across the country on 24 March 2020 and is still ongoing with
            restrictions in one form or other. It stalled the economy with complete closure imposed on
            enterprises across all sectors. Even though agricultural activities were exempted, in the
            initial phases of the lockdown the agriculture value chain also faced large-scale disruptions.
            This had a serious detrimental effect on the rural Indian economy. The coronavirus
            pandemic has also triggered a massive reverse migration from the urban to rural areas in
            large parts of the country.
            Times of crisis is a great teacher as along with the inherent challenges it can throw open
            many new opportunities. In the present corona virus pandemic also, the immediate
            challenge was restoration of the supply chains for essential commodities as well as reducing
            the plight of the distressed migrant worker. The government, through its various
            interventions specifically through the Prime Minister Garib Kalyan Yojana and MNREGA
            has provided timely relief to migrants in these difficult times. While most of the challenges
            presented by the pandemic have been efficiently handled it is also important to make use of
            the opportunities the crises provides. A case in point is the new opportunities the crises has
            thrown open in the agriculture supply chain network. In many parts of the country, FPOs
            stepped in successfully creating supply chains in the COVID scenario. There are also
            numerous examples across metros in the way groups of farmers took the initiative to ensure
            direct delivery of produce to gated communities and societies for products ranging from
            exotic avocados to perishables like regular fruits and vegetables. The entire logistics chain
            has been set in motion, but it currently lacks depth and width. An institutional fillip is
            required which builds on this with expertise can generate livelihoods at various levels.
            The migrant crisis should be looked upon as an opportunity to rethink the whole aspect of
            migration and by using the innate or acquired skills of the migrants who have moved back an
            attempt should be made to resolve the long pending problems faced by the rural sector.
            Some of the migrants working in the food and vegetable supply chain in big cities can be
            engaged with FPOs on the marketing side as they have a fair understanding of the nuances of
            marketing and consumer preferences in urban areas. There are close to 6,000 FPOs in the
            country and growing. These can be ideal institutions to absorb them gainfully.
            The Government of India through it ‘Atmanirbhar’ package has rolled out many path
            breaking reforms particularly in the agriculture and rural sector. It is now important for all
            institutions to step up and engage all stakeholders to take forward the vision of a
            rejuvenated, ambitious and self-reliant Bharat.
            I would like to congratulate DEAR team for coming out with this All India survey on the
            impact of CoVID-19 on Indian agriculture and rural economy. I hope the survey provides
            valuable insight on the impact of the pandemic on agriculture and the rural Indian economy,
            which would guide bankers and development practitioners to initiate necessary policy
            initiatives and interventions for inclusive and equitable growth of the distressed sections of
            the society in times of Covid-19 pandemic.
